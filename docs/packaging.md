To bundle an ISLE lesson as a single-page application, go to the "Export" page inside the editor. After selecting an appropriate output directory, you can start the bundling process. It might take a few minutes. After the process is finished, a new directory is created in the chosen output directory, named after the title of the lesson specified in the ISLE preamble. The exported lesson is viewable in any major web browser, and can be easily hosted on personal websites, GitHub pages or any other hosting service.
