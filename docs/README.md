# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation of the *interactive statistics learning environment* (ISLE) and the ISLE Editor for authoring interactive lessons for statistics and related disciplines.

The ISLE project is an initiative aimed at enhancing e-learning in statistics education at Carnegie Mellon University. It is generously supported by a Carnegie Mellon [ProSEED][proseed] grant for the development of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) projects.

The project is licensed under a permissive open-source license (MIT). One of our aims is to encourage statistics instructors at other universities to use it for their purposes. Since ISLE lessons are easy to embed on any given website, hosting one's own lessons is simple. For questions, please contact us via email at pgb AT andrew.cmu.edu.
