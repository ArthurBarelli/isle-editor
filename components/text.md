# Text

By default, only Markdown at the top-level will be processed. In case you wish to use Markdown syntax inside a component attribute or nested inside HTML tags, you have to wrap it inside this component. The component expects no other child elements besides text.

### Example:

``` js
<Text>*Markdown* formatted text comes here...</Text>
```
