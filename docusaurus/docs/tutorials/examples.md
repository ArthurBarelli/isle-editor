ISLE can be used for many different types of lessons. Here we cover a few examples that we've found useful in our own courses.

## Labs

At Carnegie Mellon University, we have used ISLE in introductory statistics labs for several years. [Lab 1](https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/Demo/lab01/) in 36-200 covers the basics of variables types and some plots. You can find the source ISLE file for this lab at <https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/Demo_lab01.isle>.

## Projects

ISLE can also be used to to create data analysis projects for students. The [NYC housing project](https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/Demo/nyc_project_example/) is an example of a data analysis project using New York housing data. You can find the source ISLE file for this project at <https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/Demo_nyc_project_example.isle>.

## Lecture Slides

The ISLE Sketchpad can be used to display PDF [lecture slides](https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/Demo/sample_lecture_slides/), which can be annotated in the Sketchpad and interspersed with ISLE questions for students to work on. The example shown here is courtesy of Chris Genovese and Mikael Kuusela of Carnegie Mellon University. The source file is at <https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/Demo_sample_lecture_slides.isle>.

## Video Lectures

An ISLE [video lecture](https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/Demo/sample_video_lecture/) is useful for creating a lesson that includes video lecture components combined with other ISLE components like questions and data analysis. The example linked here is courtesy of Marian Frazier at The College of Wooster, who has created video lectures for use in flipped classroom instruction.

## Homework

Finally, ISLE can be used for homework assignments that involve writing and data analysis. Here is a [homework example](https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/Demo/nyc_hw_example/) using the NYC housing data. The source file is at <https://isle.heinz.cmu.edu/Demo_nyc_hw_example.isle>.
